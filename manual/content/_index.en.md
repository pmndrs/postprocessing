# Introduction

[![CI](https://github.com/pmndrs/postprocessing/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/pmndrs/postprocessing/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
[![Version](https://badgen.net/npm/v/postprocessing)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postprocessing)

Welcome to the postprocessing manual!

## Motivation

The purpose of the postprocessing library is to provide advanced real-time image effects for the popular 3D library [three.js](https://threejs.org/). It was originally created based on the [three.js examples](https://threejs.org/examples/?q=postprocessing) in the context of a university research project in 2015 and continues to evolve as a free, open-source library.

## Compatibility Policy

Postprocessing aims to support the six most recent releases of three. Older releases may still work but are not officially supported. The release schedule of this library is not strictly tied to three, meaning that official support for the latest release can fall behind by a few days. Releases follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

> [!NOTE]
> Please note that this library is not compatible with the postprocessing examples from three due to API differences.

## Concepts

Postprocessing extends the common rendering workflow with fullscreen image manipulation tools. It uses render pipelines to group and run passes and connects resources through explicit inputs and outputs on the passes.

## Performance

This library provides an `EffectPass` that implements a structured mechanism for merging fullscreen effects into a single composite shader by gathering shader functions, varyings, uniforms, macros and individual blend functions. This minimizes the amount of render operations and makes it possible to combine many effects without the performance penalties of traditional pass chaining.

All fullscreen render operations also use a [single shared triangle](https://michaldrobot.com/2014/04/01/gcn-execution-patterns-in-full-screen-passes/) that fills the screen. Compared to using a quad, this approach harmonizes with modern GPU rasterization patterns and eliminates unnecessary fragment calculations along the screen diagonal. This is especially beneficial for GPGPU passes and effects that use complex fragment shaders.
